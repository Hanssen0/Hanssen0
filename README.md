# Hanssen's Whim

Not all types of programming are fun. Keyboards are the piano of coders, and I love to play the improvisation in my head.

Here are whims of mine. You are free to contact me.

## Who am I?

Yet another coding lover. TypeScript and Rust make me feel good, while Java kills me. I also work on Python, GoLang, C and others.

I trust that blockchain is the cornerstone of the future, but crypto trading may not.
